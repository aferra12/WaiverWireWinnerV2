The 29-year-old lefty has proven to be a dependable spot starter when called upon this season, but the Rangers aren't likely to have a permanent rotation spot available for him unless another starter succumbs to an injury. Even in that scenario, Jon Gray -- who was activated from the 60-day injured list earlier this week and moved to the bullpen -- might be the preferred option over Latz to fill any void in the rotation.",

The only blemish on Latz's performance came in the second when Zach McKinstry roped a run-scoring single. The Texas southpaw is likely to return to his usual bullpen role following this start, but it is possible he garners another turn in the rotation if Eovaldi's back injury requires additional missed time. Latz is currently enjoying the best season of his career in his fourth year with the Rangers, pitching to a 2.89 ERA, 1.25 WHIP and 51:23 K:BB across 53 innings.",
